Common Scenarios / Situations
In this document describe common scenarios and situations you might find yourselves into during your time at HackYourFuture, and we explain different ways to go about them. If you have any specific question about them we will discuss it in your first weeks of the course. Additionally, you can also ask questions on you class Slack Channel if anything is not clear at any time.

SCENARIO 1: Imagine you are stuck with your homework but at the same time you feel too shy to ask a question. What do you do to solve this problem?
You do your own research first. However do not spend TOO much time figuring things out if you are lost. Some companies have a rule: if you are stuck for more than 2 hours, you NEED to ask for help. This way no unnecessary time is wasted but you still get to learn from doing your own research. So in short:

1- Do your own research and try to solve the problem yourself (maximum 1-2 hours depending on the task at hand)
2- Ask help in your class channel: other colleagues or teachers can help.
3- If you are too shy to ask you class, you can contact a classmate, teacher or one of your mentors for some help. Still, know that a good developer knows how to communicate, how to search and how to use their time effectively. Don’t be shy!

Also keep in mind that sometimes is better to ask for guidance than simply doing it all on your own. When you ask someone that has more expertise you might find yourself learning new things. So do ask for help!

SCENARIO 2: Imagine you are in week 2 of the React Module. The homework is very challenging and you also have a family situation to deal with. You are not sure if you can finish the homework before the deadline. What will you do?
The key here is time-management and communication. You should know by mid-week if you will be on time with your homework or delayed. If delays will happen you HAVE to let your mentor know in advance. If you communicate on the same day you are supposed to hand in the homework, this won't be appreciated and is not professional.

So in short: plan your homework and study-time in advance and communicate if you foresee any challenges or delays. Communicating the same day of the deadline is not good. Think of this as a job: If you won’t finish a project in time but let everyone know WHY and WHEN the project will be ready that’s fine. If you tell your team on the delivery day that the project is not finished, your team won’t be happy, and it will be hard to find a last-minute solution.

If something ‘bigger’ happens and you can’t make it to class or won’t be able to finish the assignments in time, reach out to your mentor. We are here to help you as long as you put the effort and strive for good communication!

Note: Have you read about the 3-strike policy in the [student manual](/manual.md)?

SCENARIO 3: Imagine you are in the JS2 module, but you feel some of the homework is too easy for you. You finish most of your work in 20-30 hours instead of the 30+hours. What do you do?
If classes become too easy and you’re done with your week work in just a few hours, you can always buy a cofee for one of the mentors, see the #mentor channel on slack or visit the mentorship page on our [website](https://techrity.org/mentorship).

Jokes aside, revising previous and future modules, working on new and harder exercises, helping your classmates, building a project for your cv, are all good things to do.

Becoming a better programmer or designer is not a race against others but a race against yourself. Put yourself up for a challenge! The Internet is flooded with coding challenges and if you do not know what to do,your teachers will be happy to challenge you :) working harder and becoming a better programmer or designer will not only help your class (as you can then help others) but it will also help you, making it easier to find and grow in a job and working on more complex and challenging projects. Remember that helping others is also another way to help yourself. Explaining code to your colleagues or classmates will help you learn more about programming and this is a crucial skill to have to grow as a developer!

The last piece of advice: JS2 might be easy for you but JS3 might get a lot more challenging. Be sure to always revise and understand the fundamentals. They will help you throughout your whole career!

SCENARIO 4: Imagine you are now in a new module, but you feel the program is moving TOO fast. You can barely keep up with the homework and the classes. What do you do?
Planning your week, reading the materials before the lessons, preparing questions for QAs, sleeping well, practicing the fundamentals, etc...are all important things. Still, it can happen that you do all of that and still find yourself behind. If that is the case you should let your mentor know ASAP.

Besides helping you plan better and make a schedule, he or she will connect you with a programmer or graduate for one-on-one support sessions. Talking about this sooner is better than doing it later. The earlier we know, the earlier you can get support. Also remember you have 10+ fellow classmates who are studying the same as you do and asking for help will not only help you but also will also help the one teaching you to revise concepts and become a better programmer and designer:

SCENARIO 5: What skills do you think you need to find a job? What kind of skills do you think companies are looking for?
Good communication, a solid foundation of technical skills, proactivity, affinity, and/or ability to work in teams and independently, time management, and problem-solving skills are all important...Other things that are also important are being able to ask questions, giving and receiving feedback constructively, being able to find answers on your own and being able to explaining concepts to others.

Also, we encourage you to take the [Jobberman Soft Skills Free Training](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfa7bN6CgNSuHfVpzy8pdoK8p0SlfKtRP1e6Nw6ufiAIfJ5ww/viewform)

We discussed it internally and we came up with the ideal profile of a TMP graduate:

Has a very solid understanding of the full Techrity Mentorship curriculum.
Knows how to google - and when to ask (lots of) questions!
Knows how to present him/herself and the work he/she does.
Is a problem solver: Writes code that works - and still tests it!
Plans, prepares and communicates accordingly.
Has a good level of english both written and spoken.
Understands that there’s still a lot to be learned - and so he/she continues to study!
Understands that a great developer does a lot more than just coding - and so he/she improves in other important areas: Language, soft skills, teamwork, etc.
Is pro-active. Does not wait for others to do something but does it.
One or two months after you start the program we will have a career training where we will share a lot more about this.

SCENARIO 6: We will do our best to connect you to a company after you finish our program. But what if you finish the program and find an internship opportunity yourself? What should you do?
Let's make this clear: we will NEVER prioritise the fee before your career. Having said that, if you do find a job yourself and we try together to get the fee and it doesn't work that’s fine (almost never happened though). Still is important that we at least try as we count on that revenue to continue to operate.

Getting us in contact with the company and mentioning the fees are the best way to go. Companies are usually happy to support us! Our budget is covered in big part by organizations, but without the fee we charge to companies we cannot afford to run classes.

Additionally, when you connect us with the company, we have the chance to share information about our program and also add more companies to our partner list which could eventually hire another grad from our school. Also we will help you and the company better navigate the hiring process. Communication with us during all this process is crucial.
