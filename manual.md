# Student Guide

Welcome to Techrity Mentorship Program. Here’s a quick guide to help you make the best of this opportunity.

## Why Techrity?
People want to build their tech skills but are faced with three major challenges:
- Talent Development: Kickstart (Laptop, Data, & Mentorship)
- Build tech solutions for social good

Unfortunately, these 3 things are not equally accessible to all of us. Our universities/polytechnics haven’t prepared us for work, curriculums are old and don’t include the most important and sought after skills and proximity is sometimes a function of how connected you are.

The **Techrity Mentorship Program (TMP)** is an intensive all-in-one 3months program to give you your best shot at starting a successful career. We’ve worked with industry experts to develop this program and our curriculums. 

## Our Core Values
Here are the core values we live by. We’ll discuss these in more detail as the program progresses.

- **Teamwork and Community:** Best is not good enough. There’s always better. We keep raising the bar.
- **Innovation:** Nothing is impossible. We apply our minds and hands to solve the most complex problems.
- **Diversity and Inclusion:** Everyone is welcome.
- **Technical Growth:** We want you to grow your skills.
- **Pay it Forward:** After receiving guidance from our mentors, we encourage you to also remain in the community and mentor other.


## Our Learning Method

Welcome to something different. Learning is best when it’s immersive and engaging. It’s a combination of some theory and a big focus on personal engagement and practical applications every step of the way.

Your learning experience in Techrity Mentorship Program will include:

- Pre-class reading and videos
- 2 offline classes every week
- 1 mentor meetup per week
- Feynman hours (students teaching students)
- Monthly classroom projects
- A final class project

Not everyone will complete this process. We guarantee you that. If you do though, you’ll be positioned far ahead of your peers and will be launching your career on the best foundation you’ll find anywhere in Africa.
